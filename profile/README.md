# Beware: Slippery games!

Puddle Warning is a simple group of devs interested in making games.

We're all employed developers which means all of the games we make, are made on our free time. Don't expect anything out of these games, they start as small projects and may very well be never finished.

If any of the games which we host here are ready to be shipped to platforms we will update this file with links.

## The goal

This GitHub organization exists to give devs a place where their repositories can live. It's just so that if you are developing a game on your own, you may want others to take a look at your code and review PRs. Well then Puddle-Warning is the place for you. We make no guarantee of reviewing PRs but we do our best.

Since we're doing our best to review each other's work, we ask of everyone asking for a review to also give some of their time to review other's work.

## Join us!

If you're interested, you are more than welcome to join us! Reach out to any of the devs already part of the organization and we'll get back to you.
